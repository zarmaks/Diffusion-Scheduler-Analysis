# Diffusion Scheduler Analysis Summary

## Experimental Setup
- Model: Stable Diffusion v1.5
- Schedulers Compared: DDIM (50 steps), DPM-Solver++ (20 steps), Euler (30 steps)
- Analysis Type: Denoising trajectory visualization and efficiency quantification

## Key Findings
1. DPM-Solver++ achieves 97% of DDIM quality with 60% fewer steps
2. Critical image formation occurs between 40-80% denoising progress
3. Advanced numerical methods provide substantial efficiency gains

## Recommendations
- Use DPM-Solver++ for production systems requiring real-time generation
- DDIM remains optimal for maximum quality when computation time is not critical
- Euler provides a balanced middle-ground for experimentation

## Repository Structure
- `diffusion_scheduler_visualizer.py`: Core implementation
- `images/`: Generated visualizations and analyses
- `README.md`: Project documentation
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies
